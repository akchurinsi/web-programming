        <p class="p">
            Dear Eileen,<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as <br> 
            part of your <abbr title="Doctor Of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Starting dates</h2>

        <p>
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
            could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017 </li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br></p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.<br></p>
        <h2>Subjects of study<br></h2>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br> somewhere in the realm of 
            science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. 
            Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br> audience size exponentially 
                increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li> <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.<br></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
            <br> research to take, required staff  and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>

        <p>Polynesian chicken dance<br>
            &emsp; A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around <br>
            &emsp; in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".<br>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
            &emsp; Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
            &emsp; involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
            &emsp; tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br> 
            &emsp; modern styles such as Twerking.<br>
        Arctic robot dance<br>
            &emsp; An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
            &emsp; discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
            &emsp; of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
            &emsp; because they were really cold. For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page. 
        </p>

        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
